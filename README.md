# Helix-inspired IDEAVim Configuration

This is a configuration for IDEAVim that replicates keybindings and behaviors from the Helix editor. The aim is to provide a more efficient modal editing experience for those who prefer Helix's design but want to use it in JetBrains-based IDEs like Android Studio.

## Features

- Modal editing with custom keybindings
- Seamless switching between Insert, Normal, and Visual modes
- Fuzzy file searching and navigation
- Efficient split and window management
- Easy-to-use commenting, yanking, and pasting
- Search functionality similar to Helix
- And much more!

## Installation

1. Install the **IDEAVim** plugin in Android Studio (or your preferred JetBrains IDE).
2. Copy the `.ideavimrc` file into your home directory (e.g., `~/.ideavimrc` on Linux/macOS or `%USERPROFILE%\.ideavimrc` on Windows).
3. Restart your IDE and you're ready to go!

## Customizing

Feel free to tweak the `.ideavimrc` file according to your personal workflow. You can change keybindings, add new commands, and modify the configuration to better suit your needs.
